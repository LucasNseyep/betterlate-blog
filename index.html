                What type of product would I make and sell? Products in accessibility, creativity, and sustainable development.
                <br>
                <br>
                An interesting product category I have been thinking about is information boards. More precisely boards that track publicly available information about specific topics. Exactly like how layoffs.fyi tracks tech layoffs. Putting all layoff numbers on one, single and accessible, page. But how do you win bread from that?
                <br>
                Here are a few suggestions:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 32px;">
                  <li>Subscription service only ‚Äì No access to any of the information unless you‚Äôve paid.</li>
                  <li>Subscription service that gives you access to more detailed information. The free tier just gives minimum usable information.</li>
                </ul>
                Another interest of mine has always been hardware. But as the saying goes: ‚Äòhardware is hard‚Äô but let's just disregard it for now (sorry Lionel). The type of hardware that I'm interested in is smart home devices. Specifically, the type of devices that make a home more accessible, by being friendly to ALL users.
                <br>
                Think Google Nest. Think Microsoft Accessibility Controller. Think about a frictionless home experience no matter who you are.

                Let me start off by saying that I have a huge dislike for social media. I hate how addictive it is and hate how it makes me feel a lot of the time.
                That's why by 2019, I had uninstalled Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat from my phone. I still access them from time to time on my desktop, but I don't spend
                hours on them anymore. I'm proud to say that my weekly on screen time is below 2 hours per day. Anyways, that doesn't really answer the question does it.
                <br>
                <br>
                What I dislike about social media is the pressure I have to always be on it and always compare myself to others. I wanted a platform on which I could share things on my own terms,
                and even others don't have to hear from me unless they really want to. I just wanted to redistribute that power and attention. That's why a blog makes the most sense.
                And I got to make it from scratch too hehe.
                <br>
                <br>
                <em>So what will I be sharing on <strong>betterlate</strong></em>? Everything and anything honestly. The page will serve as many things to me. An archive of ideas, events, and creativity.
                It will also serve be a diary and a way for me to improve my writing and communication. The organisation of the different entries will be confusing since I'm also retroactively dating these things.
                Check me out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-nseyep/"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> and <a href="https://github.com/LucasNseyep/"><u>Github</u></a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                The site will go live on Monday, May the 15th 2023. My goal is to have at least 7 entries by then. Let's see if that'll be true ‚ù§.

              <p>The last weeks of the LeWagon boot camp involved building an app from scratch. I submitted an idea for a notetaking app, pitched it, and got selected by my fellow students.</p>
              <p><strong>Pitch deck</strong>:</p>

              <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Our thoughts are spread across too many mediums: notebooks, post-its, note taking apps, magazines, napkins, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Target users</strong>: People who produce original work. Students and knowledge workers who need to write essays and reports.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: An app that aggregates all thoughts no matter the shape or form (notes, figures, images, voice memos, etc...) and displays them in an accessible way.</p>

              <p><u><strong>Final Product</strong></u>:</p>
