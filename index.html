                I'm thrilled to share that I've recently completed an intensive UI/UX bootcamp. <br><br>

                Throughout the program, I designed both mobile and desktop applications on a weekly basis. One standout project was a two-week freelance experience with a London-based tech startup. On top of this, all of the projects were assessed by seasoned UX professionals who gave us invaluable feedback. That feedback, combined with self- and peer-assessments resulted in a leaderboard. This culminated in the top five students earning the incredible opportunity to present their projects to hiring startups on demo day. <br><br>

                I‚Äôm proud to say that I made it into the top five! Presenting my final project Is It Hot ‚Äì an app to navigate cities during extreme weather, in front of startup founders at the EF offices in Hoxton ‚Äì was nothing short of incredible. <br><br>

                I‚Äôve learned so much through the experience: from interviewing users to Figma handovers. I‚Äôm deeply grateful to Amaan, Sid, and the entire Pathfinder team for making all of it possible. I also want to extend a special thanks to Anastasia, Zazu, Jade, and Chloe for their support and advice over the whole of the program. <br><br>

                The completion of this course signifies a great milestone in my understanding of the tech product development lifecycle. From ideation to validation (UI/UX bootcamp and internship at McKinsey & Company), creation (web development bootcamp and software development at Shopify), and distribution (sales at Google), I‚Äôve experienced it all. And now‚Ä¶ <br><br>

                I'm actively seeking a full-time role. I‚Äôm a recent Imperial I'm eager to explore opportunities in Product Management, Software Engineering, as well as UI/UX Research and Design. <br><br>

                What type of product would I make and sell? Products that fall into accessibility, creativity, and sustainable development.
                <br>
                <br>
                An interesting product category I have been thinking about is information boards. More precisely boards that track publicly available information. Exactly like how layoffs.fyi tracks tech layoffs. Putting all layoff information in one place.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another interest of mine has always been hardware. But as the saying goes: ‚Äòhardware is hard‚Äô but let's just disregard it for now (sorry Lionel). The type of hardware that I'm interested in is smart home devices. Specifically, the type of devices that make a home more accessible, making it friendly to ALL users.
                <br>
                <br>
                Think Google Nest. Think Microsoft Accessibility Controller. Think about a frictionless home experience no matter who you are.

                Let me start off by saying that I have a huge dislike of social media. I hate how addictive it is and hate how it makes me feel a lot of the time.
                That's why by 2021, I had uninstalled Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat from my phone. I still access them from time to time through my desktop, but I don't spend
                as much time on them anymore. I'm proud to say that my weekly on screen time is below 2 hours per day. Anyways, that doesn't really answer the question does it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I created this website because I wanted a platform on which I could share things on my own terms. Others don't have to hear from me unless they really want to. That's why a blog makes the most sense.
                And I got to make it from scratch too hehe...
                <br>
                <br>
                <em>So what will I be sharing on <strong>betterlate</strong></em>? Everything and anything honestly. An archive of ideas, events, and creativity.A diary and a way for me to improve my writing and communication. The organisation of the different entries will be confusing since I'm also retroactively dating these things.

                The site will go live on Monday, May the 15th 2023. My goal is to have at least 7 entries by then. Let's see if that'll be true ‚ù§.

              <p>The last 2 weeks of the LeWagon boot camp involved building an original app from scratch. I submitted an idea for a notetaking app, pitched it, and it got selected by my fellow students.</p>

              <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Our thoughts are spread across too many mediums: notebooks, post-its, note taking apps, magazines, napkins, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>Target users</strong>: People who produce original work. Students and knowledge workers who need to write essays and reports.</p>
              <p><strong>Solution</strong>: An app that aggregates all thoughts no matter the shape or form (notes, figures, images, voice memos, etc...) and displays them in an accessible way.</p>
