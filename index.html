                Let me start off by saying that I have a huge dislike for social media. I hate how addictive it is and hate how it makes me feel a lot of the time.
                That's why by 2019, I had uninstalled Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat from my phone. I still access them from time to time on my desktop, but I don't spend
                hours on them anymore. I'm proud to say that my weekly on screen time is below 2 hours per day. Anyways, that doesn't really answer the question does it.
                <br>
                <br>
                What I dislike about social media is the pressure I have to always be on it and always compare myself to others. I wanted a platform on which I could share things on my own terms,
                and even others don't have to hear from me unless they really want to. I just wanted to redistribute that power and attention. That's why a blog makes the most sense.
                And I got to make it from scratch too hehe.
                <br>
                <br>
                <em>So what will I be sharing on <strong>betterlate</strong></em>? Everything and anything honestly. The page will serve as many things to me. An archive of ideas, events, and creativity.
                It will also serve be a diary and a way for me to improve my writing and communication. The organisation of the different entries will be confusing since I'm also retroactively dating these things.
                Check me out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-nseyep/"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> and <a href="https://github.com/LucasNseyep/"><u>Github</u></a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                The site will go live on Monday, May the 15th 2023. My goal is to have at least 7 entries by then. Let's see if that'll be true ‚ù§.
